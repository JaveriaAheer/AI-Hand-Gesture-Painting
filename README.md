# AI-Hand-Gesture-Painting
The app captures live video from your webcam and detects your hand using MediaPipeâ€™s hand tracking technology. If index finger is fully extended it activates "painting mode" and draws lines as you move your finger through the air. The rest of the hand must remain closed, only one fully open finger is allowed to draw.
